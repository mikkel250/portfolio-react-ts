      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>Hi, my name is Mikkel Ridley and I am a Front End Engineer. Over the past 3+ years, I have honed my skills in Angular, Shopify, Jekyll, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS/ SCSS, among many other technologies. Prior to transitioning to a career in software development, I managed all technology-related aspects of a local small business. This experience has provided me with a unique skill set and perspective that I bring to my work as a software developer.</p>
      <p>Outside of work, I enjoy cycling and traveling. I've been to Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Egypt, France, Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Czech Republic, Hungary, and Portugal.</p>
