          Hi, I'm Mikkel Ridley-Front End Engineer by day, aspiring crypto
          market whisperer by night. Over the past 5 years, I've navigated the
          wild world of software development, learning Angular, React, Shopify,
          Jekyll, and more along the way. But before I was writing code, I was
          managing a local small business-and its entire IT department (yes,
          that means I was the help desk, the network admin, and the coffee
          machine repair guy).
        </p>

        <p>
          If you want a developer who's equal parts tenacious autodidact, team
          player, and occasional snarky commentator,
          you've found your guy.
        </p>

          If you've made it this far, congratulations-you've survived my
          rambling! Whether you want to chat about frontend wizardry, swap
          crypto horror stories, or just say hi, I'm all ears.
        </p>
        <p>
          Feel free to reach out-I promise I don't bite (unless you're a bug in
          the code, then all bets are off).
        </p>
