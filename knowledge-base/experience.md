## Software Engineer - Front End | Jefferson Health
**Duration:** November 2021 - January 2023  
**Location:** Remote (Contract via TekSystems)

### Context
Jefferson Health, a 40,000-employee healthcare system and university, needed to modernize their branding. Initially contracted for 4 months as part of a 3-developer team, I was retained for 14 months total and promoted to lead developer after demonstrating exceptional results. Primary focus was the Shopify storefront, with additional contributions to the Marcus Institute website and development of an internal React-based ticket routing system.

### Key Accomplishments

- **Built React-Based IT Routing System:** Developed internal support ticket routing application using React, TypeScript, and Next.js that intelligently directed requests across departments. Reduced average ticket response time from 72 hours to 24 hours (3X improvement), directly impacting 40,000 employees' productivity.

- **Modernized Development Workflow:** Single-handedly transformed direct-to-production edits into professional CI/CD pipeline. Migrated from GitLab to GitHub integration, implemented protected branches, established PR review process, and trained entire team on Shopify CLI. Zero deployment failures after implementation.

- **Led Shopify 2.0 Migration:** Architected and executed complete platform migration from Shopify 1.x to 2.0. Converted 50+ Liquid templates to JSON schema, refactored legacy code into modular sections, and optimized data loading. Admin panel responsiveness doubled.

- **Implemented Design System:** Collaborated with design team to implement company-wide visual identity on specific digital properties. Delivered pixel-perfect components matching new brand guidelines, ensuring consistency across Jefferson Health web properties serving millions of patients annually.

- **Performance Optimization Success:** Reduced storefront load time by 25% using Lighthouse and PageSpeed insights.

### Business Impact
IT routing system improved employee productivity across the 40,000-person organization by eliminating manual ticket routing between departments, reducing average response time from 72 to 24 hours. Shopify performance improvements (25% faster load times) enhanced user experience for customers purchasing wellness products and booking services. Development workflow transformation enabled parallel development for 3-person team and eliminated production incidents that previously occurred regularly, establishing a professional SDLC where none existed before.

### Technical Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge:** Jefferson Health's Shopify team was editing production code directly with no version control, code review, or testing. While Shopify offered basic rollback functionality (restore by date), there was no commit history or context about what changed, making it nearly impossible to understand or safely revert changes. Multiple developers couldn't work simultaneously, and deployment failures were accepted as normal.

**Solution:** Architected and implemented complete SDLC transformation:

- **Version Control:** Migrated codebase to Shopify's GitHub integration with proper branching strategy (main, staging, feature branches). Now had meaningful commit messages and full change history instead of just timestamps.
- **Parallel Development:** Multiple developers could work on separate feature branches simultaneously, then merge to main through PR process - impossible in previous direct-edit workflow.
- **Code Review:** Established required PR review process with protected branches, ensuring all changes were reviewed before reaching production.
- **Staging Environment:** Set up proper staging/testing phase using Shopify CLI for local development and staging environment for validation before production deployment.
- **Smart Rollback:** Git history meant reverting changes was now surgical - could identify exactly what changed and why, rather than blindly restoring to a date and hoping for the best.
- **Team Training:** Created comprehensive documentation and conducted training sessions to ensure team adoption of new workflow.

**Impact:** Zero deployment failures post-implementation. Team velocity increased as developers could work in parallel without conflicts. When issues arose, rollbacks went from "restore to a date and cross fingers" to "revert specific commit with full context."

**Duration:** April 2021 - December 2021  
**Location:** Remote

### Context

Dental Game Plan, a specialized web agency serving dental practices nationwide, operated with a custom Jekyll static site generator framework. As the sole front end developer, I owned the complete front end pipeline: receiving designer mockups approved by clients, building custom templates in the Jekyll SSG system, generating static sites, and collaborating with non-technical team members who handled client data population while I completed technical implementation.

### Key Accomplishments

- **Built 6 Large-Scale Client Sites:** Delivered 6 major client websites (40+ pages each) from designer mockups to production deployment. Translated Adobe XD designs into Jekyll templates using HTML, SCSS, Liquid, and YAML, then collaborated with team to populate client-specific content and launch sites on AWS infrastructure.

- **Created Reusable Template System:** Architected templates that could be reused across multiple clients with the same design. Initial template development took 2-3 weeks, but once built, could deploy identical design for new clients in 1-2 hours - dramatically reducing delivery time for subsequent clients choosing existing designs.

- **Enhanced Jekyll SSG Framework:** Made continuous improvements to the custom static site generator based on feedback from CEO, CTO, designers, and support staff. Increased framework flexibility and stability, making it easier to implement client customizations and new features.

- **Enabled Non-Technical Team Contributions:** Built content management workflow that allowed non-developers to populate client data independently, with me handling technical implementation. This division of labor accelerated overall delivery and freed developers to focus on template creation rather than data entry.

- **Achieved 100% Client Retention:** All 6 large-scale sites I built remain active in production years after deployment, demonstrating high-quality implementation and client satisfaction. Each site continues serving dental practices with 40+ pages of content, consistent performance, and zero critical issues requiring rebuilds.

### Technologies & Skills
React 17, TypeScript, Next.js, Jekyll, Liquid, YAML, HTML5, SCSS, AWS EC2, Git, Adobe XD
