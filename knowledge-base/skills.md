---

## Education & Background

### Technical Training
- **Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp** (HyperionDev, 2019)
  - Intensive program covering full stack web development such as: HTML/CSS/JavaScript, React, Node.js, and databases
  - Built multiple full-stack projects from scratch
  - Learned collaborative development workflows (Git, code review, agile)

### Self-Taught Path
- **Primary Learning Method:** Self-directed learning through documentation, online courses, and building projects
- **Notable Achievement:** Learned Angular from scratch and was shipping production code at Google within 2 weeks
- **Continuous Learning:** Actively expanding skills (currently: OpenAI API integration, Next.js 14, Aceternity UI)
- **Philosophy:** Strong believer in learning by doing - most skills gained through building real applications

### Why This Background Is a Strength
1. **Proven Learning Ability:** Track record of rapid technology adoption (Angular in 2 weeks, TypeScript mastery, etc.)
2. **Self-Motivation:** Drove own career transition into software engineering without formal CS degree
3. **Problem-Solving Focus:** Non-traditional path developed strong debugging and research skills
4. **Adaptability:** Comfortable with ambiguity and figuring things out independently
5. **Practical Orientation:** Focus on shipping working code, not just theory

### Addressing the "No CS Degree" Question
**Key Points:**
- 5 years of professional production experience across multiple companies
- Bootcamp + self-taught path is increasingly common in tech (and valued for demonstrating initiative)
- Many successful engineers are self-taught (examples: David Heinemeier Hansson, John Carmack started young)
- What matters: Can you ship reliable, maintainable code? (Yes - 5 years of evidence)
- Non-CS backgrounds bring diverse problem-solving approaches

**If Asked Directly:**
> "I took a non-traditional path into software engineering through a bootcamp and extensive self-teaching. What I may lack in formal CS theory, I make up for with 5 years of professional production experience, rapid learning ability, and a track record of shipping reliable code. I've learned algorithms and data structures through practical application, and I'm always eager to deepen my theoretical knowledge when it benefits the work."

## Guidance for Discussing Skills

### When Asked About Professional Experience With a Technology

**If technology is in Professional list:**
- Lead with professional context (companies, years, production features)
- Provide specific examples with scale and impact
- Mention personal projects as reinforcement if relevant

**If technology is in Personal Projects only (e.g., Python):**
- Be transparent: "My [technology] experience is from personal projects, not professional production environments"
- Show capability: Describe what you've built and learned
- Provide evidence of rapid learning: Reference Angular (2 weeks) or ASP.NET examples
- Be confident: "Haven't used professionally YET, but proven track record of rapid technology adoption"
- Respect their criteria: Don't argue, acknowledge professional experience matters for depth

**Addressing the Professional vs Personal Distinction:**
- Understand recruiter concern is valid: professional experience means production constraints, code review, team collaboration, deadlines
- Personal projects demonstrate initiative and learning ability
- The real measure is hours and complexity, not just context
- Many professional skills started as personal learning (TypeScript, Next.js, etc.)
- Focus on transferable depth: architecture, testing, performance optimization apply regardless of context

**Example Response for Personal-Only Technology:**
> "I have [technology] experience through personal projects like [specific example]. I haven't used it professionally in a production environment yet, so I want to be transparent about that. However, I have a strong track record of rapid technology adoption - for example, I learned Angular from scratch and was shipping production code at Google within 2 weeks. If this role requires [technology], I'm confident I could be productive quickly, but if you're specifically looking for someone with years of professional [technology] experience, I want to be upfront that mine is from personal work."

**Key Principles:**
- Honesty builds trust
- Lead with professional strengths
- Demonstrate rapid learning ability with evidence
- Don't oversell personal project experience as equivalent to professional
- Be confident in capability without claiming expertise you don't have
