## Why I Switched to Engineering

### Deep Roots in Technology

My interest in technology goes back to the mid-1990s, navigating MUDs (Multi-User Dimensions) through university databases, Gopher services, and Telnet before Google even existed. At fifteen, I was exploring networked virtual worlds and text-based multiplayer games when the internet wasn't yet part of everyday life. 

**This reframes the career transition:** Not "random career change" but "returning to lifelong passion." The path through management and IT was building valuable skills and perspective, but technology has been a constant thread since my teenage years. Engineering isn't a new interest - it's coming full circle to where my curiosity started.

### The Catalyst

**What I loved about management and IT:**
- Solving complex organizational problems
- Improving processes and workflows systematically
- Seeing teams succeed through better systems
- Understanding how technology impacts business outcomes
- The satisfaction of fixing broken processes

**What was missing:**
- Hands-on creation and building, creativity
- Direct technical problem-solving daily
- Continuous learning of new technologies
- The immediate feedback loop of shipping features
- Building solutions with my own hands

**Software engineering provides both.** I still solve organizational problems (established CI/CD pipelines at Jefferson Health, improved workflows at multiple companies), but now I also build the actual technical solutions. The combination of strategic thinking from management plus hands-on technical work is exactly what I was searching for.

### The Honest Answer

**Why engineering?** The intellectual challenge and creative problem-solving aligned perfectly with what energizes me: continuous learning, building things that work, seeing immediate impact from my efforts. After years of managing processes and people, I wanted to be the one writing the code that makes those processes better.

**No regrets.** The path I took - management first, then engineering - makes me more valuable, not less. I understand business context, can communicate with non-technical stakeholders, and ship features that move metrics because I've lived on both sides.

## Value of Diverse Background

### What Management Experience Provides

**Stakeholder Communication (Critical Skill):**
Five years of presenting to executives, managing cross-functional teams, and negotiating with stakeholders means I excel at the communication aspects of engineering that many developers find challenging. 

**Concrete examples from engineering roles:**
- SFMOMA: Worked directly with legal team, exhibition designers, and C-level stakeholders on 3D gallery tool
- Intrinsic (Google): Presented technical tradeoffs to PMs to help prioritize features
- Jefferson Health: Trained entire team on new workflows, documented complex systems
- Multiple roles: Translated technical concepts into business impact for non-technical audiences

**Business Context (Differentiator):**
I don't just write code - I understand how features impact revenue, user satisfaction, and organizational goals. Every technical decision considers business outcomes because I've managed budgets, understood P&L, and seen how technology investments succeed or fail.

**Examples:**
- At Dental Game Plan: Template reusability transformed economics (2 weeks → 2 hours)
- At Jefferson Health: IT routing system saved massive productivity across 40K employees
- At Kul: Platform flexibility enabled rapid market testing for pivots

**Specific Management Roles at Marathon Products (2015-2020):**

At a small manufacturing company (~15 employees) serving hundreds of customers worldwide, I wore multiple hats simultaneously:

- **Customer Support & Help Desk:** Sole responsibility for technical support for hundreds of external customers across US and internationally (largest client in Japan). Handled hardware and proprietary software troubleshooting, setup assistance, and technical calibrations for data logging equipment (temperature and humidity sensors). Implemented ticketing system and improved response times by 50%.

- **IT Infrastructure Manager:** Managed onsite IT including hardware maintenance (computers, printers), Windows Active Directory administration, and coordination with MSP for server/backup management. Transitioned company to hybrid infrastructure model balancing cost and reliability.

- **QA Manager:** Administered ISO 9001 compliance programs, quality assurance processes for manufacturing, and continuous improvement initiatives.

- **Department Manager:** Led teams, managed stakeholder relationships, and drove process improvements across operations.

**Promotion Track:** Advanced rapidly from individual contributor to multiple management roles by taking initiative, identifying operational pain points, and delivering measurable improvements. Trusted with increasing responsibility in small company where every role mattered.

**Team Dynamics & Organizational Navigation:**
This management experience means I navigate complex organizations effectively. I understand stakeholder priorities, office dynamics, and how to get things done in large companies. At SFMOMA (400+ item backlog) and Intrinsic (Google bureaucracy), this skill was invaluable.

**Process Improvement DNA:**
My instinct is to improve workflows, not just work within them. Nearly every company I've joined has adopted better practices around testing, deployment, or documentation based on my initiatives:
- Jefferson Health: Established entire SDLC from chaotic direct-to-prod edits
- SFMOMA: Introduced Jest testing infrastructure to zero-coverage codebase
- Multiple roles: Documentation, training, CI/CD improvements

This comes directly from management training in operational efficiency and continuous improvement.

### What IT Infrastructure Background Provides

**Systems Thinking:**
IT infrastructure work taught me how systems connect, how failures cascade, and how to think about reliability, scale, and user impact beyond just application code. This makes me better at architecting full-stack applications.

**Examples:**
- Debugging production issues: Think beyond "is my code wrong?" to networking, DNS, infrastructure
- At SFMOMA: Managed critical .NET and Tessitura upgrades for system processing millions
- Understanding of the full stack from network to application layer

**User Empathy (Critical for Product Work):**
Years of help desk work means I deeply understand non-technical user frustrations. I build with real users in mind, not just other developers.

**Examples:**
- SFMOMA: Built admin tools for non-technical staff (eliminating JSON editing nightmares)
- Dental Game Plan: Enabled non-dev team to populate content independently
- All projects: Focus on UX, accessibility, and real user needs

**Technical Foundation:**
Networking fundamentals, server administration, database management, help desk systems - this foundation means I'm comfortable across the entire stack and can debug issues that pure frontend developers might struggle with.

---

### Why Frontend Engineering Specifically?

**Art Background & Design Sensibility:**

Academic background in art gives me a natural eye for UI/UX design, which draws me toward frontend work where creativity and technology intersect. I don't just implement features - I think about visual hierarchy, user flow, aesthetic polish, and how design impacts user experience.

**This shows up in my work:**
- **Accessibility at SFMOMA:** Combining WCAG 2.1 compliance (technical) with thoughtful UX (design thinking)
- **Pixel-perfect implementations:** Translating Figma/Adobe XD designs accurately across multiple roles
- **Portfolio attention:** Focus on professional appearance, modern aesthetics, polished interactions
- **Component design:** Building not just functional but visually appealing UI components

**The combination** of technical skills (React, TypeScript, performance optimization) plus design sensibility (visual hierarchy, UX flow, aesthetic judgment) makes me particularly effective at frontend development. I can both build it technically sound AND make it look good.

## How This Makes Me a Better Engineer

### Unique Combination of Skills

**What I bring that most engineers don't:**

1. **Technical Depth** (5 years shipping production features across diverse stacks)
2. **Business Acumen** (understand ROI, budget constraints, business priorities)
3. **Communication Excellence** (can explain technical concepts to anyone - executives, designers, lawyers)
4. **Process Improvement** (establish better workflows wherever I go)
5. **User Focus** (build for real people based on IT/support background)
6. **Organizational Savvy** (navigate complex companies, manage stakeholders)
7. **Systems Thinking** (understand how pieces connect from infrastructure to UI)

**This isn't "career change baggage."** This is competitive advantage.

### Real-World Examples

**At SFMOMA:**
- Technical: Built accessibility-compliant ticketing platform
- Communication: Worked with legal, exhibitions, stakeholders
- Process: Introduced testing infrastructure, documented complex systems
- Business: Understood museum operations, $3M annual online sales

**At Intrinsic (Google):**
- Technical: Reached Angular proficiency and shipped production code within ~3 weeks with zero prior experience
- Communication: Presented tradeoffs to PMs, collaborated across 6-person team
- Process: Worked in Google's rigorous review system
- Business: Understood enterprise robotics use cases, $1M+ equipment operators

**At Jefferson Health:**
- Technical: Led Shopify migration, built IT routing system
- Communication: Trained 3-person team, documented entire workflow
- Process: Established complete SDLC from chaos (GitHub, CI/CD, code review)
- Business: Understood healthcare operations, 40K employee impact

**The pattern:** I succeed because I bring more than just code. I bring context, communication, and strategic thinking.

## Work Philosophy & Approach

### How I Think About Work

**Work Hard, Work Smart:**
A job well done is its own reward - I take pride in quality work. But working hard doesn't mean fighting inefficient processes with more hours. It means identifying inefficiencies and fixing them to maximize everyone's output. This is why I've established better workflows at nearly every company: CI/CD at Jefferson Health, testing infrastructure at SFMOMA, documentation and training across multiple roles. Work hard on solving the right problems, not compensating for broken systems.

**Real Examples:**
- Jefferson Health: Instead of working harder within chaotic deployment process, built proper SDLC that made entire team more efficient
- SFMOMA: Instead of manually testing everything, introduced Jest infrastructure for automated testing
- Dental Game Plan: Instead of building every site from scratch, created reusable templates (2 weeks → 2 hours)

**Process Improvement as Default:**
My instinct is always "how can this be better?" not "this is how it's always been done." This comes from management background in operational efficiency and continuous improvement, but applies to everything - code architecture, deployment workflows, team processes, even personal productivity.

**Sustainable Pace with Real Urgency:**
Work-life balance matters. I'm not interested in constant crunch or "hero developer" culture. But I also understand the difference between real and invented urgency:

- **Real urgency:** Production bug affecting users, client deadline with business impact, critical security issue? I'll work evenings/weekends to solve it
- **Invented urgency:** Arbitrary deadline without engineering input? I collaborate with stakeholders to understand the real constraints and negotiate realistic timelines that work for everyone

**This boundary-setting prevents burnout** while still showing up when it truly matters. Sustainable pace makes better engineers long-term. Constant firefighting usually indicates process problems that should be fixed, not heroic individuals working unsustainable hours.

**Collaboration Over Conflict:**
When timelines don't align with engineering reality, my approach is collaborative problem-solving: "Help me understand the business need. Is it truly this date, or is that flexible? What's the minimum viable version we could ship sooner? Can we phase the rollout?" This usually leads to better outcomes than either blindly committing or flatly refusing. Communication and collaboration trump conflict every time.

**Ego-Free Engineering:**
Nobody knows everything, and those who think they do are usually nightmares to work with. The best engineers I've encountered were extraordinarily intelligent and knowledgeable while remaining humble and open to learning. I check my ego at the door - I'm happy to learn from junior developers, admit when I don't know something, and ask questions rather than pretend expertise. Pride in quality work? Yes. Pride that prevents learning or collaboration? No thanks.

**Quality Over Speed (Usually):**
Ship fast, but ship right. Technical debt is real, and shortcuts accumulate. I'd rather take an extra day to build it properly than save a day now and spend a week fixing it later. That said, sometimes "good enough" really is good enough (MVP mindset) - the key is conscious decision-making about trade-offs, not accidental technical debt.

**Initiative and Ownership:**
Don't wait for permission to fix obvious problems. If I see inefficiency or technical debt, I propose solutions and drive improvements. This has led to process improvements at nearly every company. Better to ask forgiveness than permission when making things better (within reason).

## Handling Common Questions & Concerns

### "Why did you wait until [age/later in life] to become an engineer?"

**Response Framework:**
> "I didn't wait - I was building my foundation. The management experience taught me how software impacts business outcomes and how to work with diverse stakeholders. The IT background gave me technical fundamentals and systems thinking. When I made the transition to engineering in 2020, I wasn't starting from zero - I had context that most bootcamp grads and junior engineers lack. 
>
> That foundation means I ship features that move business metrics, not just clean code. At Jefferson Health, I didn't just build a routing system - I understood the 40,000-employee organizational impact. At SFMOMA, I worked effectively with legal and exhibition teams because I understand stakeholder management. This broader perspective makes me more valuable, not less."

**Key Principles:**
- Don't be defensive about timeline
- Reframe as strategic foundation-building
- Provide concrete examples of how it helps
- Focus on value delivered, not time spent getting there

### "How many total years of experience do you have?"

**Response Framework:**
> "I have 5 years of software engineering experience shipping production features across diverse tech stacks - React, Angular, ASP.NET, Shopify. Before transitioning to engineering, I spent 5 years in management and IT infrastructure, which gave me valuable business context and stakeholder communication skills that make me a more effective engineer today."

**What NOT to volunteer:**
- Total years across all careers (don't add them up)
- Detailed pre-engineering timeline
- Age or dates that reveal age

**If pressed on total years:**
> "I understand you're asking about depth of experience. What matters most is my 5 years as a software engineer - that's the relevant professional context. My prior management and IT background provides transferable skills like stakeholder communication and process improvement, but my engineering expertise comes from those 5 years shipping production features."

**Redirect to:** Technical accomplishments, recent work, what you can deliver

### "Are you a career changer?"

**Response Framework:**
> "Yes, I transitioned to software engineering in 2020, and it's been the best professional decision I've made. I bring a unique combination - 5 years of engineering experience PLUS business context from management background. This means I ship features that create business value, communicate effectively with stakeholders, and improve team processes. The non-traditional path is actually a competitive advantage - I have perspective most engineers lack."

**Tone:** Confident and positive, not defensive

### "Why should we hire someone who switched careers?"

**Response Framework:**
> "Because I bring more than just code - I bring business context, communication skills, and process improvement thinking. Look at my track record: At Jefferson Health, I established an entire professional SDLC where none existed. At SFMOMA, I worked cross-functionally with legal and exhibition teams. At Google (Intrinsic), I reached proficiency and shipped production code within ~3 weeks despite zero Angular experience.
>
> The question isn't 'why hire a career changer?' - it's 'why hire an engineer who ONLY has engineering experience when you could hire someone with engineering skills PLUS business acumen, stakeholder management, and organizational navigation expertise?' The diverse background is a feature, not a bug."

**Key:** Turn the question around - diverse background is value-add

### "Do you regret not starting engineering earlier?"

**Response Framework:**
> "Not at all. If I'd started at 22, I'd be a pure engineer without business context or management skills. The path I took means I understand how software impacts organizations, can communicate with executives, and improve team processes. That makes me more valuable. I'm not just a coder - I'm someone who can own features, work with stakeholders, and deliver business outcomes. The foundation was worth it."
